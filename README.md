# hyprworkspace

Hyprworkspace is a simple [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) helper to open the next available empty workspace.

## Usage

```sh
$ hyprworkspace [--max <MAX_WORKSPACES>]
```

This will immediately open the next available workspace, if there is one available. You can control how many workspaces you want available with the `--max` argument.
